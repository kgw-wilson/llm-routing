# Experiment 4 Difference of Prompt and REsponse embeeddings

task_vec = response_emb - prompt_emb

Interpretation:
“What information was added by the model?”

## Results

Again, similar to experiment 3, the mean accuracy across all models was 0.5% higher than in experiment 1 and 1% higher than in experiment 2. This shows a slight improvement when considering both prompt and response but nothing substantial.
